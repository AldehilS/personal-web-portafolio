# Personal web portafolio
My personal web to show my portafolio as a developer.


## 2nd delivery Coderhouse course:

* I used flexbox to arrange the elements of the navbar, as well as in the main card on the homepage.
* I used grid as well to arrange the project cards as well as on the skills page.
* I used pseudo-classes to change the color of the buttons in the navbar and the contact form button, as well as to highlight the cards when hovering over them.
* Finally, I utilized the Bootstrap framework to create a contact page, similar to the one I had previously made. The link to this page is in the navbar under the name 'Bootstrap'.

## 3rd delivery Coderhouse course:

* SASS implemented.
* Redesigned responsive layout.
* Added animations to the card elements, as well as the navbar links and buttons. The main card also has an animation when loading the page.
* SEO optimization with meta tags and changed title of the pages.
