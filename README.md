# Personal web portafolio
My personal web to show my portafolio as a developer.


2nd delivery Coderhouse course:

I used flexbox to arrange the elements of the navbar, as well as in the main card on the homepage.
I used grid as well to arrange the project cards as well as on the skills page.
I used pseudo-classes to change the color of the buttons in the navbar and the contact form button, as well as to highlight the cards when hovering over them.
Finally, I utilized the Bootstrap framework to create a contact page, similar to the one I had previously made. The link to this page is in the navbar under the name 'Bootstrap'.
